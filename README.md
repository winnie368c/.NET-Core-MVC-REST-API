**The following techniques and technologies were used in the creation of this application:**
* REST API principles
* HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH)
* Dependency injection
* Repository pattern
* Entity Framework Core O/RM (DBContext, Migration)
* Data Transfer Objects
* AutoMapper
* SQL Server Express
* SwaggerUI & Postman to Test API Endpoints
* Docker - image, container, and deployment to Docker Hub
* Azure Data Studio
